# Evaluation

There is an example for evaluating our long CoT model on Alpaca Eval 2.

```
# generate responses
python generate_alpaca_eval2_cot.py

# process data (into the format required by Alpaca Eval 2)
python data_process_cot.py
```

Refer to [Alpaca Eval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval.git) for further steps.
